mnflash
.......

An upload utility to flash new firmware onto devices running the Micronucleus
bootloader. It currently understands raw, Intel hex and ELF files (with format
auto-detection) and could select a matching firmware for a given device.


libmnflash
..........

The library that implements all the functionality of mnflash.

- reading and dumping firmware binaries
- find and connect USB devices
- send and receive packets through USB control messages
- retrieve device information from the bootloader
- erase, flash and run a new application.

While its main purpose is to make the upload functionality available for other
software, you may find the individual parts useful too.


Example
.......

There is an example to show how you could use the library to build a
specialized version of "mnflash", that knows how to upgrade the firmware on
your specific device without manual intervention (besides running the program).


Building
--------

Prerequisites
.............

* libusb

* libelf

  On Ubuntu, you need libelf1 and libelf-dev, which apparently come from the
  "elfutils" project. But other implementations of the ELF API should work as
  well.

Compile
.......

Just the usual

  ./configure
  make
  make install


Configure options
.................

  --prefix         (default: /usr/local), installation path prefix
  --enable-shared  (default: no), build a shared library.


Building the example
....................

Install the library first, then run "make".

The example Makefile uses pkg-config, this can easily be changed if you don't
have that.


Portability
-----------

This software does compile on Linux and it should compile on OS-X/Darwin too.
Getting it to run on Windows will almost certainly require more work.

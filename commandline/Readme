This commandline application for the Micronucleus bootloader is written by ihsan Kehribar <ihsan@kehribar.me>

I have only tested this application on my Ubuntu machine so far. Might need little tweaks for the Windows and Mac platforms.

Usage example:
	sudo ./micronucleus name_of_the_file.hex

Binary file writing and program memory reading hasn't been implemented yet.

Program sometimes sporadicly crashes and fails to upload the user application. User should unplug and re-plug the device and restart the application if such situation happens. I hope this problem will be solved in the future.

This commandline application for the Micronucleus bootloader is written by
ihsan Kehribar <ihsan@kehribar.me> and Bluebie <a@creativepony.com>

It's been tested casually on Mac, Windows, and Linux, and aught to work on all
three. To make and install, do the regular 'make; sudo make install' on unixes.
On windows just 'make' with mingw and do whatever people do with windows exes.

Usage on Linux:
  sudo micronucleus --run name_of_the_file.hex
Usage on Mac:
  micronucleus --run name_of_the_file.hex
Usage on Windows
  micronucleus.exe --run name_of_the_file.hex

Raw binary file writing hasn't been tested much yet and is suspected to not
work.

Root privileges (via sudo) are generally needed on Linux because the kernel does
not allow direct userspace access to USB devices by default.

Every now and then the program fails once it reaches the Writing stage - this is
a known bug - but if you simply rerun the micronucleus command immediately, it
will succeed the second time usually. Most of the time this issue is not present.

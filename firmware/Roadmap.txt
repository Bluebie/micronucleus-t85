Development Roadmap

1.x Improvements (No protocol change, micronucleus host tool stays the same)

Changes to client firmware:
	- Only time out bootloader if program is loaded - done
	- Move clean boot page to initialization - done
	- Integrate blargg optimizations  
		* turned "event"-variable into register to save memory
		* moved flash buffer clean to hardware initialization function
	
2.x Improvements (New Protocol, new command line tool)

Changes to client firmware:
	- New device support (84,841,167,861)
	- External oscillator option
	- polled USB
	- enter bootloader by external reset
	
Changes to protocol/command line tool
	- Send different delay times for erase and program to support 481
	- Transmit data in value and index field, don't use data payload to reduce code size and improve v-usb stability
	- Move writing of tiny vector table to host tool. Reset vector patching stays on client
			-> no risk of bricking device, since bootloader will remain active
	- erase command
	- CRC check

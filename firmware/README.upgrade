Micronucleus Upgrade
====================

**WARNING**: Upgrade requires more testing. Don't use it on chips you can't
recover by other means. Consider it experimental for now.

Upgrade is a virus-like payload you can upload via micronucleus (or other
bootloaders) to install a new version of micronucleus on the target chip. The
upgrade program works by copying the contents of a bootloader hex file in to a
progmem array, then bricking the device so it doesn't enter the bootloader on
reset but instead runs the upgrader program exclusively. Next it erases and
rewrites the bootloader in place at the same address the hex file specifies
(BOOTLOADER_ADDRESS in the case of micronucleus). Once the bootloader has been
rewritten, upgrade rewrites it's own interrupt vector table to point every
interrupt including reset straight at the newly uploaded bootloader's interrupt
vector table at whichever address it was installed.


Creating an Upgrader
====================

The upgrade firmaware is built together with the according bootloader firmware.

Just upload the "upgrade.hex" file for your target with the micronuceus upload
tool. Flashing this file with a "normal" ISP programmer and "avrdude" works too.
